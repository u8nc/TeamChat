# TeamChat
A test bed of Group Chat ideas for use by instructors.

A Chat app where there are differing combinations of visibilty between the participants and the leader. This finds use in classroom environments where students feel a single personal connection and the teacher, but the teacher has a one-to-many relationship with each student but still posts instructional material only once.

A variant is also when a group leader is able to switch participant statuses in and out according to the context of the situation.

It is also hoped that chat histories can be made visible to newcomers to the chat. 
Currently this project will use a combination of Firebase and On-device Data Persistence using Realm.
